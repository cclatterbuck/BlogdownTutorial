# Biography

Corey Clatterbuck is a PhD Candidate at the Conservation Ecology Lab at SDSU. Her research addresses the effects of anthropogenic change to ocean and coastal environments to better predict and, hopefully, prevent future chemical pollution in marine systems. She is the Student Representative of Pacific Seabird Group and leads the Diversity & Inclusion student group in the SDSU Biology graduate program, which works to make biology more accessible and equitable for all participants.
